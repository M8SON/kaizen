# MiniClaw

An open-source, modular voice assistant designed for Raspberry Pi. Think Jarvis, but running on a $120 board in your living room.

Built around a skill-based architecture where capabilities are defined as lightweight markdown files and executed in sandboxed Docker containers. Compatible with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skills out of the box.

## How It Works

```
Microphone → Whisper (speech-to-text) → TierRouter (<5ms, no LLM)
    ├─ deterministic → skill called directly        (stop, volume, goodbye)
    ├─ micro         → Claude Haiku → skill → Haiku response
    │                  (whole turn escalates to Sonnet on error)
    └─ claude        → Claude Sonnet → skill → Sonnet response
         → Kokoro TTS (text-to-speech) → Speaker
```

**Tiered intelligence** keeps Claude Sonnet as the premium reasoning layer — invoked only for complex, ambiguous, or meta requests. Routine tool calls route to Claude Haiku (the "micro" tier) with a slimmer prompt, and the most common commands bypass LLMs entirely. See [Intelligence Tiers](#intelligence-tiers) for details.

The system uses two layers for extensibility:

**Skill layer** — Lightweight `SKILL.md` files that teach Claude *when* and *how* to use a tool. These are just markdown with YAML metadata, costing zero memory until invoked. Compatible with OpenClaw's skill format, giving you access to community-built skills.

**Container layer** — Each skill executes inside a sandboxed Docker container that spins up on demand and tears down after. This keeps the Pi's RAM free and provides security isolation between skills.

## Features

- Tiered intelligence — deterministic dispatch for instant commands, Claude Haiku for routine tool calls, Claude Sonnet for complex reasoning
- Wake word detection using a sliding Whisper window — any phrase works, no training required (default `"computer"`)
- Optional Hailo-backed full transcription on Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 (wake detection remains CPU Whisper)
- Conversation session mode — stays active between follow-ups until idle timeout
- Streaming TTS — Kokoro chunks play as they're generated; ONNX backend ships fp32 + int8 variants (~2–3× faster than the PyTorch baseline on Pi 5)
- Voice skill installation — say "add a skill that does X" and Claude Code writes, builds, and loads it
- Self-improving skills — bundled skills can autonomously refine their own routing hints based on usage
- Persistent memory — plain markdown notes for transparency, with MemPalace preferred by default when installed
- FTS5 session archive — every conversation turn is searchable via the `recall-session` skill
- Cron-style scheduler — yaml-backed recurring tasks fire natural-language prompts through the orchestrator
- Music: Spotify Connect (raspotify), SoundCloud (yt-dlp + mpv), unified `music-control` voice transport
- Modular skill system — agentskills.io-compatible (single-directory, kebab-case)
- OpenClaw skill compatibility — use existing community skills
- Docker-sandboxed execution — security by default, resource-capped containers; native execution path for host-integration skills
- Visual dashboard skill — voice-triggered monitor display with news/OSINT, weather, stocks, and music
- R2-D2 style audio feedback — startup chime and thinking sound
- Run on boot via systemd — installer ships in-tree (see [Run on boot](#run-on-boot-raspberry-pi))
- Text mode for development and testing without a microphone

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- Node.js 18+ with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) — required for voice skill installation
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- `espeak-ng` system package (`sudo apt install espeak-ng`) — required by Kokoro TTS
- Microphone + speaker (for voice mode)
- Optional: [Brave Search API key](https://brave.com/search/api/)
- Optional: HDMI monitor + `chromium-browser` (`sudo apt install chromium-browser`) — required for the dashboard skill

### Recommended Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB or 16GB RAM)
- NVMe SSD via M.2 HAT+
- Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 (for Hailo-backed wake detection and transcription now, Kokoro offload later)
- Active cooler
- USB microphone

## Cost

### Hardware

Two practical build tiers:

**Budget build** — Pi 5 only, CPU inference, no NPU or SSD:

| Component | Est. Cost |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) | ~$80 |
| Official power supply (27W USB-C) | ~$12 |
| USB microphone | ~$20 |
| Small speaker | ~$20 |
| **Total** | **~$132** |

**Recommended build** — full setup with AI HAT+ 2 and NVMe SSD:

| Component | Est. Cost |
|---|---|
| Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB) | ~$120 |
| Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 (Hailo-8L) | ~$70 |
| M.2 HAT+ (NVMe adapter) | ~$12 |
| NVMe SSD (256GB) | ~$28 |
| Active cooler | ~$5 |
| Official power supply (27W USB-C) | ~$12 |
| USB microphone | ~$20 |
| Small speaker | ~$20 |
| Case | ~$10 |
| **Total** | **~$297** |

Prices are approximate and vary by region and retailer. The AI HAT+ 2 is optional but strongly recommended for always-on deployments — MiniClaw currently uses it for Hailo-backed wake detection and full transcription, with Kokoro acceleration still remaining on the roadmap.

### Yearly Electricity

See [Power Consumption](#power-consumption) below for the full breakdown. Summary:

| Build | Avg draw | Annual cost (US) | Annual cost (UK) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Budget (CPU inference) | ~7W | ~$8/yr | ~$17/yr |
| Recommended (target with broader NPU offload) | ~4–5W | ~$5/yr | ~$11/yr |

Running costs are negligible — the hardware pays for itself in utility long before electricity becomes a concern.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M8SON/miniclaw.git
cd miniclaw
./run.sh --install-system-deps  # Debian/Ubuntu only: installs Docker + audio system deps
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
./run.sh          # text mode (default, no microphone needed)
./run.sh --voice  # voice mode
./run.sh --list   # list loaded skills and exit
```

`run.sh` handles Python setup automatically: creates the virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and builds any missing Docker containers before launching.

## Optional: Hailo Whisper Offload

MiniClaw can offload **full post-wake transcription** to a Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 / Hailo device. Wake detection currently stays on CPU Whisper (the published Hailo wake encoder needs a 10s window, the wake loop buffers 2s — silence padding produced hallucinations, so wake-on-Hailo was reverted).

- wake detection runs on CPU Whisper (`WAKE_MODEL`, default `tiny`)
- full utterance transcription can run on Hailo Whisper (`WHISPER_MODEL_HAILO`, `base` or `tiny`)
- the transcription path falls back to CPU automatically if the Hailo runtime or assets are missing

### Pi prerequisites

Install the Hailo runtime on the Pi:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y hailo-all ffmpeg libblas-dev nlohmann-json3-dev
sudo reboot
```

Verify the device and runtime:

```bash
hailortcli fw-control identify
ls /dev/hailo0
```

### Python environment note

MiniClaw's default `run.sh` creates a normal `.venv`. On many Pi installs, the `hailo_platform` Python module is provided by the system package, so you may want MiniClaw's virtualenv to see system site-packages:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `python3 -c "import hailo_platform"` already works inside `.venv`, you do not need to recreate it.

### Download MiniClaw Hailo assets

Download the HEFs and decoder assets into MiniClaw's user-scoped model store:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/download_hailo_whisper_assets.py --variant base --hw-arch hailo8l
```

Assets are stored under:

```text
~/.miniclaw/models/hailo-whisper/
```

### Validate on the Pi

Run MiniClaw in voice mode:

```bash
./run.sh --voice
```

Expected startup line when transcription is on Hailo:

```text
STT backend: Hybrid Whisper (wake=cpu:tiny, transcription=hailo:base)
```

Full CPU fallback line if Hailo is unavailable:

```text
STT backend: CPU Whisper fallback (wake=cpu:tiny, transcription=cpu:small) — <reason>
```

If you see CPU fallback when expecting Hailo, the likely causes are:

- `hailo_platform` is not visible inside `.venv` (recreate with `--system-site-packages`)
- `~/.miniclaw/models/hailo-whisper/base` is missing assets
- the selected `WHISPER_MODEL_HAILO` variant has no published HEF (only `tiny` and `base` exist today)

Current limitation: Hailo currently accelerates Whisper only. TierRouter and Kokoro are unchanged, and Kokoro offload is still future work.

System packages are separate because they require privileged OS changes. On Debian/Ubuntu, you can opt into that setup with:

```bash
./run.sh --install-system-deps
```

That installs `docker.io`, `espeak-ng`, `mpv`, and `portaudio19-dev`, then starts the Docker service.

On systems where Docker was just installed, `run.sh` also adds the current user to the `docker` group. If the current shell has not picked up the new group yet, the launcher will try to continue automatically via `sg docker` for that run.

If a later shell still does not have Docker access, refresh your login session and verify with:

```bash
id
docker info
```

## Testing

MiniClaw now includes a small `unittest` smoke suite for core non-audio behavior, including:

- conversation history normalization and pruning
- native config-writing behavior for `set_env_var`
- the `install_skill` voice flow via injected test doubles instead of live voice, Claude Code, or Docker builds

Run it with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

There is also a single standard test entry point:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

Optional layers:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh --voice    # scripted voice-loop harness, no mic/speaker needed
./scripts/test.sh --install  # real install_skill integration using Claude CLI + Docker
./scripts/test.sh --all
```

There is also an optional real integration harness for the `install_skill` flow. It uses the real Claude CLI and real Docker build path, but replaces microphone confirmation with scripted responses so it can run unattended:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_install_skill_integration.py
```

Notes:
- it requires `claude`, Docker, and valid auth/config on the machine
- it creates a disposable skill and image, then cleans them up by default
- pass `--keep-artifacts` if you want to inspect the generated files afterward

The scripted voice-loop harness exercises the real `run_voice_mode` control flow with a fake voice interface, so it covers wake detection/session management/exit behavior without audio hardware:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_voice_mode_harness.py
```

## Adding Skills

Just ask:

> *"computer, add a skill that tells me a random joke"*

Claude Code writes the skill files, validates them, and walks you through three confirmation steps before building and loading the skill. No coding required. See `skills/skill-tells-random/` for an example of a skill created this way.

To port a community [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill:

```bash
python3 scripts/port-skill.py /path/to/openclaw-skill/
```

For the skill file structure and developer details, see `CLAUDE.md`.

## Memory

MiniClaw can remember things across conversations. Just say:

> *"computer, remember that my wife's name is Sarah"*
> *"computer, don't forget I prefer temperatures in Celsius"*
> *"computer, make a note that the garage code is 1234"*

Memories are saved as markdown files in `~/.miniclaw/memory/` (configurable via `MEMORY_VAULT_PATH`). Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md` with YAML frontmatter.

**How recall works:**

- **Startup** — vault notes are synced into a local chromadb vector store and the most recent ones are injected into Claude's system prompt
- **Per message** — semantic search over the vector store surfaces relevant memories alongside the user's request, even when the phrasing doesn't match exactly (e.g. asking "what's my wife's name?" finds a note that says "Sarah is Mason's spouse")
- chromadb is included in the default dependencies — no extra setup required

**Obsidian integration** — open `~/.miniclaw/memory` as an Obsidian vault to browse, search, edit, or delete memories with a full GUI. Since the files are plain markdown, everything works out of the box.

### MemPalace

[MemPalace](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace) is the **recommended/default recall layer when installed** because MiniClaw's default `MEMORY_BACKEND=auto` setting prefers it automatically. MiniClaw still remains vault-backed: memories are always stored as markdown notes in the vault, and when `chromadb` is available they are also synced into a local vector store for semantic recall. Installing MemPalace does not replace that storage model. Instead, MiniClaw prefers MemPalace's Python API or CLI for:

- **Wake-up memory** — curated startup summaries via `mempalace wake-up`
- **Per-message recall** — semantic search via `mempalace search`
- **Browsing/debugging** — using the MemPalace CLI against the same local palace directory

If MemPalace is not installed, MiniClaw still keeps semantic recall working through direct `chromadb` access. In other words:

- **Vault markdown files** remain the source of truth
- **chromadb** provides the actual local vector store
- **MemPalace** is the preferred wake-up/search interface when available

```bash
pip install mempalace
mempalace init ~/projects/miniclaw-memory
```

Leave `MEMORY_BACKEND=auto` to get the default behavior: use MemPalace when installed and otherwise fall back to direct `chromadb` access. Set `MEMORY_BACKEND=mempalace` only if you want to force MemPalace usage, or `MEMORY_BACKEND=vault` to disable the MemPalace/chromadb semantic layer entirely.

## Intelligence Tiers

MiniClaw routes each voice command through a three-tier gate before any LLM runs:

| Tier | Model | Latency | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic** | — (regex) | <5ms | "stop", "volume up", "goodbye" |
| **Micro** | Claude Haiku | ~1–2s | "play some jazz", "what's the weather" |
| **Claude** | Claude Sonnet | ~2–5s | "make a skill that...", "remember that...", ambiguous or multi-step requests |

The router classifies each transcript (`core/tier_router.py`) using:
1. **Dispatch patterns** — regex table (`config/intent_patterns.yaml`). Match → skill called directly, no LLM.
2. **Escalate patterns** — phrases Haiku handles poorly (skill installation, memory edits, long explanations) → routed straight to Sonnet, skipping Haiku to avoid double latency.
3. **Skill prediction** — reuses the existing `SkillSelector`. Skills in `CLAUDE_ONLY_SKILLS` go to Sonnet; everything else goes to Haiku.

When Haiku errors (network blip, malformed response), the whole turn escalates to Sonnet via try/except — no history is lost.

**Enabling the micro tier:**

```bash
# In .env
MICRO_TIER_ENABLED=true
MICRO_TIER_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5
```

Leave `MICRO_TIER_ENABLED` unset or `false` to send every request to Sonnet.

## Power Consumption

MiniClaw is designed to run 24/7, so wake detection power draw is worth considering.

Wake word detection runs a tiny Whisper model every 2 seconds on a 2-second audio window **on CPU** (via `faster-whisper`). The Hailo integration accelerates full post-wake transcription, not the always-on wake loop.

| Mode | Avg system draw | Est. annual usage | US (~$0.13/kWh) | UK (~$0.28/kWh) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current wake loop (CPU inference) | ~7W | ~61 kWh | ~$8/yr | ~$17/yr |

**CPU mode:** `faster-whisper` tiny inference on Pi 5's Cortex-A76 takes roughly 0.3–0.8s per 2-second clip, putting wake detection at 15–40% CPU utilization continuously.

**Current Hailo mode:** the Hailo-backed path helps the heavier full-transcription step after wake, reducing post-wake CPU load and latency, but it does not yet change the always-listening wake-loop power profile.

## Run on boot (Raspberry Pi)

To make MiniClaw start automatically when the Pi powers on:

```bash
./scripts/install_systemd_service.sh
```

The installer is idempotent — re-run it any time the unit file changes. It will:

- Copy `config/systemd/miniclaw.service` to `~/.config/systemd/user/`.
- Enable `loginctl enable-linger` so user services start at boot (asks for sudo).
- Ensure `/var/log/journal` exists so logs survive reboot (asks for sudo).
- Enable + start the service.

### Day-to-day

```bash
systemctl --user status miniclaw      # is it running?
systemctl --user start miniclaw       # start after a manual stop
systemctl --user restart miniclaw     # restart after a config change
systemctl --user stop miniclaw        # stop until next boot or manual start
journalctl --user -u miniclaw -f      # tail live logs
journalctl --user -u miniclaw -p err --since '1 hour ago'   # crashes only
```

### Uninstall

```bash
./scripts/uninstall_systemd_service.sh
```

> Hailo wake offload was implemented and reverted: the published wake encoder needs a 10s window, but the wake loop only buffers 2s of audio, so silence padding produced hallucinations. To re-enable, the wake loop would need to accumulate 10s before invoking the Hailo transcriber, or Hailo would need to publish a shorter-window wake HEF.
